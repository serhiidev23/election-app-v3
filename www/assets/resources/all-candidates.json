Stevens\u0027 leadership was often characterised by patrimonial rule and self worship, consolidating power by means of corruption and exploitation.[1]\n\nStevens and his All People\u0027s Congress (APC) party won the closely contested 1967 Sierra Leone general elections over incumbent Prime Minister Sir Albert Margai of the Sierra Leone People\u0027s Party (SLPP). In April 1971, Stevens made Sierra Leone a republic and became president a day after the constitution had been ratified by the Parliament of Sierra Leone. He was the second President of the Republic after Christopher Okoro Cole, a judge, who was sworn in for a day after which he resigned, paving the way for Stevens.\n\nStevens served as Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) from 1 July 1980 to 24 June 1981 and engineered the creation of the Mano River Union, a three-country economic federation of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.\n\nStevens retired from office at the end of his term on 28 November 1985. After pressuring all other potential successors to step aside, he chose Major-General Joseph Saidu Momoh, the commander of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces, as his successor.","CandidatePhoto":"siaka_stevens.jpg"},{"CandidateSLEOP_ID":"3737","Prefix":"Dr.","FirstName":"Ahmad Tejan","MiddleName":"","SurName":" Kabbah","Suffix":"","PoliticalParty":"Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP)","ElectionYear":"2002","ElectionType":"Presidential","Profile":"\u003Cp\u003EAlhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah (February 16, 1932 \u2013 March 13, 2014) was the third President of Sierra Leone, serving from 1996 to 1997 and again from 1998 to 2007. An economist and attorney by profession, Kabbah spent many years working for the United Nations Development Programme. He retired from the United Nations and returned to Sierra Leone in 1992.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIn early 1996, Kabbah was elected leader of the Sierra Leone People\u0027s Party (SLPP) and was the party\u0027s presidential candidate in the 1996 presidential election. He was elected President of Sierra Leone in the 1996 election with 59% of the vote, defeating his closest rival, John Karefa-Smart of the United National People\u0027s Party (UNPP), who had 40% in the runoff vote and conceded defeat. International observers declared the election free and fair. Kabbah campaigned on a promise to end the civil war, if elected president. During his inauguration speech as president, Kabbah repeated his promised to end the civil war, which he indeed achieved later in his presidency.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA devoted Muslim, Kabbah was born in Pendembu, Kailahun District in Eastern Sierra Leone, though he was raised in the capital Freetown.

Together they had five children. Kabba and his wife Patricia Kabbah were married in 1965 and they remained married until Patricia Kabbah died from an illness in 1998. Kabbah was very closed to his wife Patricia and the two were often seen together in public before and during Kabbah\u0022s presidency. Patricia Kabbah was very influential during her husband Kabbah\u0022s presidency and she focused mainly on humanitarian issues and she was very outspoken for the ending of the civil war, though she did not live to see the end of the civil war in 2002.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EA year after he left office as president, and ten years after the death of his wife Patricia, Kabbah married Isata Kabbah, an ethnic Mandingo and a Muslim in an Islamic wedding ceremony in Freetown.

He was soon returned to power after military intervention by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), led by Nigeria. Another phase of the civil war led to United Nations and British involvement in the country in 2000.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAs President, Kabbah opened direct negotiations with the RUF rebels in order to end the civil war. He signed several peace accords with the rebel leader Foday Sankoh, including the 1999 Lom\u00e9 Peace Accord, in which the rebels, for the first time, agreed to a temporary cease fire with the Sierra Leone government. When the cease fire agreement with the rebels collapsed, Kabbah campaigned for international assistance from the British, the United Nations Security Council, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to help defeat the rebels and restore peace and order in Sierra Leone.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EKabbah declared the civil war officially over in early 2002. Tens of thousands of Sierra Leoneans across the country took to the streets to celebrate the end of the war. Kabbah went on to easily win his final five-year term in office in the presidential election later that year with 70.1% of the vote, defeating his main opponent Ernest Bai Koroma of the main opposition All People\u0027s Congress (APC). International observers declared the election free and fair.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYouth and education\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nAlhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was born on February 16, 1932, in the rural town of Pendembu, Kailahun District in the Eastern Province of British Sierra Leone.
